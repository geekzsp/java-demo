The Apache Quickstep (incubating) team is pleased to announce the release
of Quickstep 0.1.0 (our first release!)

Quickstep is a high-performance SQL database which auto-manages
configuration. Because Quickstep has very few tuning parameters, it can be
efficiently deployed in a variety of environments.

The release is available @ https://quickstep.incubator.apache.org/release


We'd like to thank our mentors who patiently helped us understand Apache
IP, introduce us to Apache RAT, and mainly for their help with day-to-day
questions related to the Apache way of things. Especially big thanks to our
very open mentors Roman, and Julian.

Also a big thanks to Josh, and John who in addition to our mentors, helped
review and give feedback for our release.

Finally, a big thanks to Jignesh for driving the Apache transition. And, of
course, all of our committers for making Quickstep!

Thank you,

The Apache Quickstep (incubating) team
